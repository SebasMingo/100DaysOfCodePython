# BMI Calculator
# Instructions

# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.
# Example Input

# weight = 80

# height = 1.75

# Example Output

# 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

# 26

# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# Hint

#     Check the data type of the inputs.
#     Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
#     Remember PEMDAS.
#     Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).

int_height = float(height)
int_weight = float(weight)

bmi = int_weight / (int_height ** 2 )

bmi_as_integer = int(bmi)
