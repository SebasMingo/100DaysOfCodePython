# Who's Paying
# Instructions

# You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
# Example Input

# Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe

# Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.
# Example Output

# Michael is going to buy the meal today!

# Hint

#     You might need the help of the len() function.

#     Remember that Lists start at index 0!



# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
import random
len_names = len(names)
random_names = random.randint(0,len_names)

chosen_name = names[random_names]

print(f"{chosen_name} is going to buy the meal today!")
